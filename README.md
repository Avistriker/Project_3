Tic Tac Toe Game

This Python code creates a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game with both single-player and two-player options. Players can interact with the game through a visual interface that displays the board and allows them to make moves by clicking buttons. The game keeps track of turns, checks for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals), and declares a winner or tie when appropriate. In single-player mode, a basic AI takes the computer's turns, prioritizing the center cell but also capable of choosing random empty squares.
